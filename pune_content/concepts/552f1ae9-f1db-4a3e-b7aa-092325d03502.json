  "explain": "Integration testing is a software testing technique where multiple individual components or modules of a system are combined and tested together. Unlike unit testing, which checks components in isolation, integration testing focuses on verifying that different modules interact correctly. It ensures proper data flow, communication, and compatibility between components. The goal is to identify defects that occur when modules are integrated, such as interface mismatches or incorrect data handling. Common approaches include top-down testing, bottom-up testing, and sandwich testing. Integration testing helps ensure the system functions correctly as a whole.",
