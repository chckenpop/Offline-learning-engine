      "explain": "Gravity is not just a force that pulls objects towards each other, but also warps space-time according to Einstein's general theory of relativity. This warping of space-time is what creates the gravitational attraction between objects.",
      "example": "Consider the analogy of placing a heavy ball on a stretched rubber sheet. The ball creates a dent in the sheet, causing smaller objects placed on it to move towards the ball. This visualization represents how massive objects like planets warp the fabric of space-time around them, leading to gravitational effects.",
