# Offline-First Learning Platform

## Goal
Build an educational web application that works fully offline using a local learning engine, structured content, and SQLite for persistence.

## Core Principles
- Offline-first (no internet required for learning)
- Local learning engine controls flow and progress
- Structured text-based content, not media
- Internet used only for delta updates

## Tech Stack
- Python (learning engine)
- SQLite (local persistence)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (UI)
- Supabase (optional content updates)

## Status
In active development.
